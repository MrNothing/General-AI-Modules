# General-AI-Modules
AI modules that generalize basic concepts. I dont not believe in the concept of a "general AI", when i say general, i mean that they can be applied to human problems. It is my belief that our intelligence comes from preprogramed features that are stacked on top of each other. To me, the path to artificial human intelligence lies in creating those building blocks, that will give us the power to manipulate more abstract concepts.

Avaliable modules: 
- Depth Map: Generates a depth texture from a single image.
- Video Depth Map: Generates a depth texture from a sequence of images.

Future modules:
- Movement Map: Generates a map showing each pixel movement as a vector
- Scene Estimator: Uses multiple depth maps and movement maps to generate a 3D voxel map.
- Scene Predictor: Uses a 3D voxel map to predict the future state of a scene.
