# General-AI-Modules
AI modules that generalize basic concepts. I dont not believe in the concept of a "general AI", when i say general, i mean that they can be applied to human problems.

Avaliable modules: 
- Depth Map: Generates a depth texture from a single image.
- Video Depth Map: Generates a depth texture from a sequence of images.
Future modules:
- Movement Map: Generates a map showing each pixel movement as a vector
