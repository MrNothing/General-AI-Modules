# General-AI-Modules
I dont not believe in the concept of a "general AI", when i say general, i mean modules that can be applied to human problems. It is my belief that our intelligence comes from preprogramed features that are stacked on top of each other. To me, the path to artificial human intelligence lies in creating those building blocks, that will give us the power to manipulate more abstract concepts.

Avaliable modules: 
- Depth Map: Generates a depth texture from a single image.
- Video Depth Map: Generates a depth texture from a sequence of images.

Future modules:
- Movement Map: Generates a map showing each pixel movement as a vector.
- Physics Estimator: Generates a 2D map of the physical properties of each pixel in an image.
- Scene Estimator: Uses multiple modules to generate a 3D voxel map with advanced properties.
- Scene Predictor: Uses a 3D voxel map to predict the future state of a scene.
