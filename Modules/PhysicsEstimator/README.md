# Movement Estimator

A model trained to generate 2D movement maps from 2D inputs.

TODO: Create a unity dataset generator; each material should be associated to a specific physics property. Ideally, the smoothness should be associated to splippery surfaces etc... a very complex but fascinating problem!
